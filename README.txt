Project: StockLTSMTransformerQuantum
Author: Michael P. Williams

---

OVERVIEW
--------
StockLTSMTransformerQuantum is a PyQt5-based application for forecasting stock prices using classical (LSTM, Transformer, GRU+CNN) and quantum (QML via PennyLane) neural networks. It supports real-time diagnostics, visualization, and trading strategy simulation.

---

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Python 3.12 or later

Install required packages using:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Note:
- The `ta` package wraps TA-Lib indicators. If you experience build errors on macOS, install TA-Lib via Homebrew:

    brew install ta-lib

---

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys and desired tickers:

Example `.env`:
    POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_api_key_here
    ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_api_key_here
    TICKERS=AAPL,TSLA,GOOGL

---

HOW TO RUN
----------
1. Activate your virtual environment:

    source .venv/bin/activate  (on macOS/Linux)
    .venv\Scripts\activate     (on Windows)

2. Set up your `.env` file with the correct keys and tickers.

3. Launch the GUI:

    python main.py

4. In the GUI:
   - Select a stock ticker and model (LSTM, Transformer, GRUCNN, QML)
   - Choose a data source (Polygon, Yahoo, AlphaVantage)
   - Click 'Run' to start training and forecasting

---

OUTPUT
------
- Forecast CSVs are saved to: `forecasts/{ticker}/`
- Training metrics and logs are saved to: `training_logs/{ticker}/`
- Debug trading logs (optional) saved to: `logs/trade_debug.txt`

---

VERSION TRACKING
----------------
To log your Python and package versions, run:

    python versions.py

Sample `versions.py`:
----------------------
import pkg_resources
import platform

print(f"Python: {platform.python_version()}")
for dist in pkg_resources.working_set:
    print(f"{dist.project_name}=={dist.version}")

---

NOTES
-----
- Only a subset of historical stock data is included in this ZIP to limit size.
- All models are trained locally using CPU; no cloud services required.
- GUI includes forecast plots, model metrics (MAE, MAPE, RÂ², Sharpe), and optional debugging overlay.
