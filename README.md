# 📈 StockLTSMTransformerQuantum

A PyQt5-based AI stock forecasting app that combines classical and quantum machine learning models to simulate, visualize, and evaluate trading strategies across multiple time horizons (Short / Medium / Long).

---

## 🔍 Overview

**StockLTSMTransformerQuantum** is an end-to-end forecasting and trading simulation toolkit that enables side-by-side comparison of:

- 🧠 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- 🧠 Transformer
- 🧠 GRU + CNN Hybrid
- ⚛️ QML (Quantum Machine Learning via PennyLane)

It features a GUI for interactive use, real-time model training diagnostics, metrics visualizations, trading signal simulation, and optional debug logging.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ GUI built with PyQt5
- ✅ Multi-tab layout (Forecasts + Training Diagnostics)
- ✅ Model comparison with MAE, MAPE, R², Sharpe Ratio
- ✅ Toggleable debug logs
- ✅ Support for both Yahoo Finance and Polygon.io as data providers
- ✅ Training and forecast export (CSV)
- ✅ Training history auto-saved per model
- ✅ "Save Forecast" and "Open Folder" buttons
- ✅ Color-coded plots and dropdown data source switching
- ✅ Robust exception handling and logging

## 📊 Models

| Model        | Architecture             | Highlights                       |
|--------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `LSTM`       | 2-layer LSTM             | Great for sequential time series |
| `Transformer`| Multi-head Attention     | Captures long-term dependencies  |
| `GRUCNN`     | Conv1D + GRU             | Combines pattern extraction + memory |
| `QML`        | PennyLane quantum model  | Lightweight and interpretable    |

```

---

## 🛠 Usage

1. Set your `.env` file:

```
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

2. Launch the GUI:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Select ticker, model, and data source (Polygon/Yahoo).
4. Train model, visualize predictions, and export results.
